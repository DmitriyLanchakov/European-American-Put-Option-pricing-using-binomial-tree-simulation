# European-American-Put-Option-pricing-using-binomial-tree-simulation
This file contains my work from the course: STAT G6505 Stochastic Methods in Finance from Columbia University, Mathematics of Finance M.A program

With regard to formulas in exercise 3.8, Shreve vol II. Let the interest rate r=2%, the volatility =20%, the current spot is S_0=10. Use a binomial tree with n=100 steps to 

(a) compute the price of an European put (K,T)=(10,1)

(b) do the same thing for an American put (K,T)=(10,1)

(c, d)  Use your code to plot the relationship between the underlying stock price and the option price i.e., (S, V)-profile, at time t=0.25, 0.5, 0.75 in different colors.
